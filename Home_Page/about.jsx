            Hi, I’m Joel Sedillo, a student at USC majoring in CE/CS and minoring in music production. A big passion of mine is creating things from the ground up, whether it’s this sick web interfaces, an electric gocart, or an app. I love problem-solving and bringing my ideas to life, always looking for new ways to push my skills and create meaningful projects.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Beyond tech, music is another major creative outlet for me. I have been teaching myself the ins and outs of music production for around 2 years and have decided to pick up a minor in the subject while I am here at USC. Focusing on crafting original beats, learning music theory, and learning from my inspirations. I love the process of experimenting and refining my work until it feels and sounds right. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Whether I’m programming or producing, I’m always excited by the process of creating something unique and impactful.
